prototype-form-1-node
=====================

This is the first prototype form for Formal. It's going to replace the "Join
the beta" form that we're currently using Google for.

Requirements
------------

- [ ] shows the user a form like https://forms.gle/o1MMoseruYJxCSBW6
- [ ] has validation on the email address (like the google form does)
- [ ] when the form is submitted, stores the user's response somewhere (google sheets might be good enough for now)
- [ ] has CSRF protection, and mitigations for anything else relevant to a simple form.
- [ ] hosted somewhere reasonably reliable
- [ ] linked to from [https://www.formal.dev](https://www.formal.dev)
